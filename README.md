# Image-Processing-with-OpenCV-Python-

•There is bio medical engineering which uses a lot of image processing techniques. Also there are research institutes which require people skilled in OpenCV. OpenCV can also be used very widely in Robotics applications, and as everyone knows, automation using robots is the future!

•The Vision community witnessed a paradigm shift towards learning representations (what is popularly known as Deep Learning, or DL), instead of using hand-crafted features (LBP, SIFT, SURF, HoG etc). The support for DL in OpenCV is still in its formative stages (this was the last time I checked, things might have improved a bit now). But that shouldn't be a point of concern because OpenCV has always been more of a Computer Vision library than a ML one. Also, the Python API for OpenCV allows it to be used quite comfortably with other Python-based DL libraries such as Tensorflow or PyTorch. Similarly, there are OpenCV bindings for Lua if you are a Torch user
